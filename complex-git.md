# Introduction to Complex Git Features

## Branching

_Brnaching_ is the process of organizing small (or perhaps large!) variations in the code. Branches are useful
for developing new features, identifying a slow-to-change branch which is the "stable" or "production" version of
the code, and many more! However, there are lots of opinions about the best practices for using branches within a git
project. You'll need to discuss with your team what approach is right for you and your team.

An overview is available at the [official git documentation for branching workflows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows)
and you can also read [the perspective of Atlassian, a major software development tool manufacturer](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).


## Tags

A _tag_ in git is just a commit with a special name attached that makes it easy to go back to. For more information, see 
[the git tag documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)
